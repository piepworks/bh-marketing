  Templates render the content of your pages.

  They contain the markup together with some control structures
  like loops or if-statements. The `$page` variable always
  refers to the currently active page.

  To fetch the content from each field we call the field name as a
  method on the `$page` object, e.g. `$page->title()`.

  This home template renders content from others pages, the children of
  the `photography` page to display a nice gallery grid.

  Snippets like the header and footer contain markup used in
  multiple templates. They also help to keep templates clean.
